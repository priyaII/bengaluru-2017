Area Suraksha Mitras (ASM) formed by Bengaluru City Police – Janaagraha CP model
-The BCP–Janaagraha initiative was launched after an elaborate baseline survey of ‘security threat perception index’ covering 300 households carrying 103 questions. The survey threw up positive feedback. About 75% of the citizens felt that CP is an effective way to improve safety and security, 84% felt it would increase awareness among citizens while 60% felt that CP would help the police and 76% felt that citizens show confidence in a citizen-volunteer.

This committee of ASMs called the Jana Suraksha Samiti
- These 500-odd ASMs working closely with the beat constables have conducted nearly 5,000 awareness programmes at the beat level, covering various policing challenges ranging from terrorism to safety of women and chain-snatching to child abuse.
-  These and other awareness drives, including street plays and door-to-door campaigns, have successfully sensitized nearly 4 lakh citizens in the areas covering these police stations. More than 1,000 members form part of WhatsApp groups spearheaded by the beat constables in 58 beats, constantly sharing citizens’ problems. Many are the success stories of beat constables working in tandem with ASMs.

- This democratic, citizen-friendly and participatory policing method is picking up pace in the country and is being implemented under different banners — Maithri in Andhra Pradesh, VishvasYojana in Himachal Pradesh, Friends of Police in Tamil Nadu, Sahayata West Bengal, Prahari in Assam, and Janmaithri in Kerala. The States of Assam, Kerala and Chhattisgarh have incorporated CP in their respective Police Acts.
